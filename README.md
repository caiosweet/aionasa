# ENAE380 Final Project - aionasa

An async python wrapper for the NASA open APIs. ([api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/))

Our final project is the [aionasa.epic module](https://github.com/nwunderly/aionasa/tree/enae380/aionasa/epic).
This README will be a guide to using that module.


### Installing

The project branch of aionasa can be installed from source with the command:
```shell
pip install -U git+https://github.com/nwunderly/aionasa@enae380
```
Where `pip` is the pip command relevant to your machine's Python 3.8 installation.
This could be `pip`, `pip3`, `python -m pip`, or `python3 -m pip`.


### Running example code

Example code using this module can be found [here](https://github.com/nwunderly/aionasa/tree/enae380/examples).


### Using the CLI/GUI

The GUI tool is launched by running the `aionasa.epic` module as a script, with the `python -m` command.

**(\_\_\_MORE EXPLANATION HERE\_\_\_)**

The `--help` option will give a breakdown of how to use this command:

```shell
python -m aionasa.epic --help
```
